#  Regex to DFA Converter

A web-based tool that transforms regular expressions into deterministic finite automata (DFA), visualizing the process step-by-step. Built with React.js and Vite for a fast and interactive user experience.

## üß† Features

- **Regex Parsing:** Supports standard operators like * (Kleene star), | (union), and concatenation
- **Syntax Tree Generation:** Constructs a syntax tree from the input regular expression
- **DFA Construction:** Converts the syntax tree directly into a DFA without intermediate NFA steps
- **Interactive Visualization:** Displays the DFA graphically, allowing users to trace transitions 
- **Real-time Feedback:** Updates the DFA visualization as the user modifies the regular expression
